# Pin Pro

> A discord bot that lets you pin like a pro.

I used the discord API to build a simple bot that will let you read, remove and add custom pins that can even be accessed across different servers if they have the same bot.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Discord API (discordrb)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby
- Git

### Install

- Clone the repo to your local machine using git.
- Navigate to the projects directory.
- Execute `gem install 'discordrb'` to get the discord API.

## Usage

- The bot has three commands pin, read and remove and has '%' as prefix.
- You can pin text using this syntax, `%pin <text>`, read all your pinned text using `%read` and remove pins using `%remove (index of item to remove)`.
- If you want to fork this project and work on a similar bot, make sure to replace ENV['TOKEN'] with your bot's token id.
